/**
 A smart lattice line extractor, that performs considerably smarter operations when searching for lines to analyse, thus increasing performance. Note that this line extractor focuses on performance, not completeness, meaning that only lines that are possible to contain the search strings are implemented.
 
 Not yet implemented, but will soon be.
