#Legend:
#—- ’s’ indicates the size of each side
#   of the lattice. Do not change this value unless
#   you really know what you are doing.
#— ‘f’ indicates the default character. positions in
#   the lattice that are not explicitly mentioned in
#   this file will get this value
#— ’d’ indicates a position in the lattice. always comes
#   in the form ’d:<lattice>,<column>,<row>=<character>’
#   change manually the values you need. Be careful, you
#   must preserve proper format.
